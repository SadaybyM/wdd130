    <p>
      I am an Engineer in Computer Systems from Pedro Henr√≠quez Ure√±a University. 
      I have accumulated experience in technology through internships and freelance work, 
      specializing in programming, backend and frontend development, simulation systems, and project management.
      My skills include proficiency in C#, Angular, Python, SQL, Unity, and Odoo development, 
      where I have solved technical and functional issues and provided consultancy services for project planning and execution.

    <p>
      I am from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
      I enjoy reading research books and doing word search puzzles. In my free time, I also like
      watching anime and mystery series. I love rivers, and in my country, there are many. I would love to
      travel the world and discover its wonders. I also enjoy music a lot and love singing pop and ballad
      songs. My passion for technology drives me to continuously improve my skills and expand my knowledge.
      One day, I hope to become an important figure in system development and to be a positive
      influence for the youth of the future, helping them to embrace technology and use it for the betterment of society.
